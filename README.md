# Object Oriented Design
Object-oriented design is the process of planning a system of interacting objects for the purpose of solving a software problem.
#Overview
An object contains encapsulated data and procedures grouped together to represent an entity. The "object interface" defines how the object can be interacted with. An object-oriented program is described by the interaction of these objects.
